# PART ONE

# 1. We have some code which is meant to calculate an item cost
#    by adding tax. Tax is normally 5% but it's higher in
#    California (7%).

#    Turn this into a function. Your function will pass in
#    the default tax amount (5%), a state abbreviation, and the
#    cost amount as parameters.

#    If the state is California, apply a 7% tax within the function.
#    Your function should return the total cost of the item,
#    including tax.

#    If the user does not provide a tax rate it should default to 5% 

def cost_w_tax(*args):
    """
    This function calculates a total cost of an item based on CA tax,
    an identified non-CA tax or a default 5% tax if the user does not include 
    a tax in in the parameter.

    if len(args) == 2:
    #Evaluates whether two arguments are passed into the function (no tax rate)

            #the tax rate divided by 100 (so that it exists as a decimal)
        total = cost + cost * tax
        #Assigns total as the result of cost plus cost times tax to total

    return total
    #Returns the total resulting from the applicable conditions. 

print cost_w_tax(9, 'WA', 30)
#This line calls the functino with sample details (9 percent tax, Washington as
#the state and thirty as the base cost). The printed result is 32.7.

#I have assumed that, unlike the practice exercise, a user may input a whole
#(ex. 9) instead of a decimal (ex. .09) for the tax rate. The function either 
#assigns a decimal rate or divides a non-CA rate by 100 to get a usable decimal.
#I have also assumed that function arguments will be entered in the order they 
#appear in the instructions for the purposes of indexing.

# PART THREE

# 1. Write a function ``increment()`` with a nested inner function, ``add()`` 
#    inside of it. The outer function should take ``x``, an integer which

#globally before the function is declared. Is that the intention here? Otherwise, 
#you can only pass an x when you call the function, correct? Y will remain 
#unassigned? 

# 2. Call the function ``increment()`` with x = 5. Assign what is returned to a variable name, addfive. Call 
#    addfive with y = 5. Call again with y = 20.
